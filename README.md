# Transfer learning

## I had some questions about transfer learning and decided to answer myself doing simple experiment

## How it would look?
It would be simple experiment on image dataset. It would be binary problem.

Decided to check if NN learned using transfer learning and similar dataset can be better than one NN learned on one big dataset. How it would impact on performace?
